# Future-Forecasting-Analysis-on-COVID-19
In this project we have used the Novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset [1] and experimented
with four machine learning like Linear Regression, Knn Regression,
Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression. We trained
and evaluated the stated model and found out Decision tree model performed
better than other models on forecasting analysis from the Novel
Corona Virus 2019 dataset.The Decision tree model achieved mean absolute
error is 449.2677827453796 which is comparetively low then other modelâ€™s
mean absolute error.
In future, we plan to collect a more enriched dataset which will help us to
analysis on future forecasting with higher confidence. In addition to this, we
also plan to extend this work to evaluate time series forecasting to process of
analyzing time series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions
and inform strategic decision-making. We will also use other higher level
models and deep learning techniques perform.
